    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes a quarter’s worth of transactional order data from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine to evaluate menu performance, revenue drivers, and operational efficiency. The goal is to move beyond descriptive insights and deliver clear, data-backed recommendations that improve profitability and operational decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using transaction-level order data, this analysis identifies underperforming menu items, high-value orders, peak and off-peak demand periods, and cuisine-level opportunities for menu optimization and staffing alignment."

    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Restaurants often face margin pressure due to menu bloat, inefficient staffing, and misalignment between customer demand and operational resources. Without data-driven insights, decisions around menu changes and staffing levels are typically based on intuition rather than evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses the following core questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Which menu items and categories truly drive value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Where are resources being allocated inefficiently?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can menu and staffing decisions be optimized to improve profitability?"

    "1. Identify high- and low-performing menu items based on order volume and revenue contribution.\n",

    "2. Analyze category- and cuisine-level performance to uncover demand patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Examine high-spend orders to understand purchasing behavior and revenue concentration.\n",

    "4. Evaluate temporal ordering trends to identify peak and off-peak periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Assess operational efficiency by aligning order volume with staffing demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Provide actionable recommendations for menu optimization and staffing adjustments."
